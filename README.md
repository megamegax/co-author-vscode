# Co-Author for VSCode

Based on [git-coauthors](https://github.com/rjimenezda/vscode-coauthor) and compatible with the [Co-Author - plugin for JetBrains IDEs](https://github.com/hawser86/co-author-plugin)

## Features

Easily adds co-authored-by strings to your commit message.

Just select 'Change pairing buddies' and a list of the repo contributors will show up. You can add / remove them from here.

Whenever you're ready to write a commit, run the command 'Add co-author strings', and the extension will automatically add the name & email so github can identify them.
